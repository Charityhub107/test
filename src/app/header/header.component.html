      This Privacy Policy (&ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) describes how Charity Hub, LLC
      ("Charity Hub," &ldquo;we,&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) collects, uses, and
      discloses information.<strong
        ><u
          >Please read the entire Privacy Policy before using our Website.</u
        ></strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Terms not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy have the definitions
      assigned in the Charity Hub Terms of Use (sometimes referred to as the
      &ldquo;TOU&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personal information&rdquo; means information about an individual
      who is either identified or reasonably identifiable. This policy applies
      to individuals.
    </p>
    <h4>1. Information We Collect</h4>
    <p>
      We will not collect Personal Information about You unless You provide us
      that information voluntarily such as via correspondence and other
      information that You send to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may collect certain other information automatically when You visit the
      Website, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your browser type and operating system;</li>
      <li>
        Your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is the number automatically
        assigned to Your computer whenever You access the Internet and that can
        sometimes be used to derive Your general geographic area;
      </li>
      <li>
        Other unique identifiers, including mobile device identification
        numbers;
      </li>
      <li>Pages You view and links You click on within the Services;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We may use cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies to automatically
      collect this information. Cookies are small bits of information that are
      stored by Your computer&rsquo;s web browser. Pixel tags are very small
      images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as "web
      beacons" or "clear GIFs,&rdquo; that can recognize cookies, the time and
      date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is
      placed, and similar information from Your computer or device.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the Website, You consent to our use of cookies and similar
      technologies. You can decide if and how Your computer will accept a cookie
      by configuring Your preferences or options in Your browser. However, if
      You choose to reject cookies, You may not be able to use certain online
      products, services, or features on the Website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some web browsers may transmit &ldquo;do-not- track&rdquo; signals to the
      websites with which a user communicates. Because of differences in how web
      browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear
      whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they
      even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard
      concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such
      signals, Charity Hub currently does not take action in response to these
      signals.
    </p>
    <h4>2. How We Use Collected Information</h4>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We may allow third parties to place and read their own cookies, web
      beacons, Local Shared Objects, and similar technologies to collect
      information through the Services. For example, our third-party service
      providers may use these technologies to collect information that helps us
      with traffic measurement, research, and analytics.
    </p>
    <h4>4. Security</h4>
    <p>
